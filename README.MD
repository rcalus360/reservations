Your goal is to create a REST API, and a consumer for that API using Angular.

The Reservations REST service should:
1) Create a reservation for a lecturer at a given lecture hall.

2) List the current reservations, with their lecturers and lecture halls.


The Angular web site should:
1) Give a user a form to create a new reservation
2) Allow the user to view all reservations.
