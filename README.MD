Your goal is to add a REST API, and a consumer for that API using Angular to the existing solution

The Reservations REST service should:
1) Create a reservation for a lecturer at a given lecture hall.

2) List the current reservations, with their lecturers and lecture halls.


The Angular web site should:
1) Give a user a form to create a new reservation
2) Allow the user to view all reservations.


TIPS:
1) Download .NET Core 2.0 https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.0
2) We are looking for clean coding and good architecture more so than a working solution.
3) For any help, https://google.com is your friend.
